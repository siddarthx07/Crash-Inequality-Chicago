Even though our team is made up of computer scientists, we are effectively bringing in the
urban/transportation vertical by leveraging domain-specific data and methods. Our project
doesn’t stay in the abstract, it directly engages with urban planning questions using real
transportation datasets.
Description of the Project
Topic
This project aims to analyze urban road safety in Chicago by identifying crash inequalities
across neighborhoods and intersections, with a focus on detecting evolving crash hotspots.
Traffic crashes remain a critical public safety issue, but they are not evenly distributed: certain
intersections and corridors are disproportionately affected. Understanding these inequalities and
predicting future crash-prone areas can help policymakers design safer streets and prioritize
infrastructure improvements.
What We Plan to Do:
Conduct descriptive analysis of Chicago crash data to identify neighborhoods
with high crash counts and severity.
Planned Steps
● Data Collection and Integration: Use Chicago Traffic Crashes datasets (Crashes +
People tables) from the City of Chicago Open Data Portal. Supplement with
OpenStreetMap for road networks and Census data for neighborhood boundaries.
● Data Preprocessing: Clean and merge crash records with location data, map crashes
to intersections/neighborhoods, and handle missing or inconsistent fields.
● Exploratory Data Analysis: Identify crash frequency trends across time,
neighborhoods, and intersections using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
● Network Construction: Build a road intersection network where nodes represent
intersections and edges represent connecting streets, weighted by crash counts.
● Network Science Analysis: Compute centrality measures (degree, betweenness,
closeness) to identify high-risk intersections and vulnerable corridors.
● Machine Learning Prediction: Train classification models (Logistic Regression,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict which intersections will become future
hotspots, using temporal crash data, road attributes, and network features.
● Visualization: Create heatmaps and choropleth maps to highlight current and predicted
crash hotspots across the city.
Prior Research
Prior studies show that traffic crashes cluster in high-traffic corridors and are more frequent in
disadvantaged neighborhoods. Machine learning models have been applied to predict crash
severity and identify high-risk intersections, while spatial statistics (e.g., Moran’s I, LISA) have
been used to detect clustering. However, most analyses treat crashes as static - this project
extends prior work by combining temporal hotspot evolution, network science, and machine
learning to model how crash hotspots change over time.
Datasets that We Plan to Use
● Chicago Traffic Crashes – People: Records of people involved in crashes, including
injury type, location, and severity.
● Chicago Traffic Crashes – Crashes: Location, date, time, road conditions, and severity
of crash events (used to map crashes to intersections).
● OpenStreetMap (OSM): Road and intersection data for constructing the intersection
network.
● U.S. Census Bureau (ACS): Demographics (population, income, car ownership) to
understand social inequalities in crash exposure.
