# KEY FINDINGS FOR PAPER
## 1. PREDICTIVE MODELING
- Best model: Gradient Boosting with temporal validation
- Test set performance: PR-AUC = 0.772, ROC-AUC = 0.946
- F1-Score: 0.691 (Precision: 0.676, Recall: 0.708)
- Historical crash count is the dominant predictor (90% importance)
- Temporal validation shows expected performance drop vs. random split
## 2. CRASH INEQUALITY
- Significant disparities exist across income quartiles (ANOVA p < 0.05)
- Negative correlation between median income and crash rates
- Low-income communities experience higher crash exposure per capita
- Severe injury rates vary by neighborhood demographics
## 3. SPATIAL CLUSTERING
- Crashes exhibit significant positive spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I > 0)
- LISA analysis identifies High-High clusters (hotspots surrounded by hotspots)
- Spatial clustering confirms crashes are NOT randomly distributed
- Targeted geographic interventions are justified
## 4. NETWORK SCIENCE
- Network centrality measures contribute to prediction (degree, betweenness, closeness)
- High-centrality intersections are at elevated crash risk
- Road network structure influences crash patterns
## 5. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
- Model can identify future hotspots before crashes occur
- Persistent hotspots (current + predicted) require immediate intervention
- Emerging hotspots (predicted only) enable proactive safety measures
- Inequality findings support equitable resource allocation
## FOR ABSTRACT (150-200 words)
We analyzed traffic crash inequality across Chicago's 77 community areas using
machine learning, network science, and spatial statistics. Our Gradient Boosting
model achieved PR-AUC=0.772 and ROC-AUC=0.946 on temporally-validated test data,
successfully predicting future crash hotspots. Historical crash frequency was the
dominant predictor (90% importance), followed by network centrality and recent
crash activity. Inequality analysis revealed significant disparities: low-income
communities experience higher crash rates per capita (ANOVA p<0.05). Spatial
autocorrelation analysis (Moran's I) confirmed crashes cluster geographically,
with LISA identifying specific High-High cluster zones requiring intervention.
Our findings demonstrate that crash risk is neither random nor equitably
distributed, supporting data-driven, geographically-targeted, and equity-focused
traffic safety interventions in urban environments.
